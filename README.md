# Pendulum-Reservoir

Python3 codes implementing the single pendulum reservoir architecture described in the article "Machine-learning potential of a single pendulum" (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.054203).

The codes are just for reference and may NOT produce the exact same results as presented in the article.
Necessary modifications are required for specific scenarios.
